# MarkdownMS

A skeleton academic manuscript in markdown. With this reprository I want to create the perfect template for academic writing.

This should include:

1. Bibliography citations and references
1. Captions for figures and tables
1. References to a figure or table 
1. Double space
1. An easy way to switch journal styles
1. and more!
